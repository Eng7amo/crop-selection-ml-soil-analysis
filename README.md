# Crop Selection Using Machine Learning and Soil Metrics

## Overview
This repository presents a machine learning project focused on helping farmers select the most suitable crop for their fields based on measurable soil characteristics.

Using supervised multi-class classification, the project predicts the optimal crop type given soil nutrient levels and identifies the single most important soil feature influencing predictive performance.

---

## Business Context
Accurate soil testing can be expensive and time-consuming, forcing farmers to prioritize which metrics to measure.

By leveraging machine learning, farmers can:
- Make informed crop selection decisions
- Maximize crop yield
- Reduce unnecessary soil testing costs
- Improve long-term land productivity

---

## Project Objectives
- Train multi-class classification models to predict crop type
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy
- Identify the most predictive soil feature
- Provide a lightweight, interpretable decision-support tool for farmers
